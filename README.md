# One Video

[Full documentation here](https://mitya.uk/projects/one-video)

One Video is a harmonised video player API providing interaction with embedded YouTube, Vimeo and native HTML5 video players.  It works with any video embed HTML already present in the DOM - so an `iframe` element for YouTube/Vimeo embeds, or a `video` element for native HTML5 video.
